# Catalog Management System

## Project Description

The Catalog Management System is a RESTful API developed with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. This application allows users to manage a catalog of products. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products in the catalog. This project demonstrates the use of Spring Boot for building RESTful services and PostgreSQL for managing relational data.
